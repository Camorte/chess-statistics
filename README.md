# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Starting the application

To start the application run these two commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Known bugs/Future work

Currently these are open issues that have not been resolved:

- Castling is not taken into account when updating the position of the pieces
- The application does not flag which pieces have been captured
